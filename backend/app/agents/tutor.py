"""Tutor Agent — Pydantic AI agent for Socratic tutoring.

Per ADR-0003: Pydantic AI is the primary agent runtime.
Per ADR-0018: the Tutor is one of five distinct Agent Roles, each with
its own Context Gate settings, tool set, eval gates, and memory access.

The Socratic Gate (CONTEXT.md) enforces: no solution code, no direct
answers, response ends with a question. This is a permanent architectural
component — the gate is never relaxed.

When no GOOGLE_API_KEY is set, the agent falls back to a TestModel
that returns canned Socratic responses for local development.
