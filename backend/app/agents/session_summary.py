"""Session Summary Agent stub — produces compressed pedagogical summaries.

Per ADR-0022: the SessionSummaryAgent receives a serialised event list and
nothing else. Its output is verified against the session's actual
ConceptMasteryUpdated events before the Event Emitter writes it. The agent
never has access to the MemoryStore directly.
